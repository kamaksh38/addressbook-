The web application is known as address book. It is an application used to store firstname , lastname , email , phone number to a web server. 
The language used for the front end is Bootstrap and javascript and for the backend PHP. I have used XAMPP server for mysql server which runs on a localhost.
To run this app install XAMPP and transfer the following code to XAMPP/htdocs and run it on localhost/index.php
